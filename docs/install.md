# Install

Install using:

```
pip install drf-typed
```

**Python 3.8** or higher is required. The only required dependency is Django REST Framework.

## Optional

If you'd like to use Pydantic as an alternative to DRF serializers, you can also install that package:

```
pip install pydantic
```

Don't forget to [enable](/views/third_party_schemas/) Pydantic as a third-party schema.
